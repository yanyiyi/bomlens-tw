description: Call the BomLens scanner Docker image directly with docker run, for CI runners, Kubernetes jobs, and other environments where the script cannot live.

# Use the Docker image directly

For everyday use we recommend the [`scan-sbom.sh`](../reference/cli.md) script, which handles language detection, image selection, and volume mounts for you. This document explains how to call the image directly with `docker run` in environments where the script cannot live (CI runners, Kubernetes jobs, and so on).

## Images and tags

| Image | Purpose |
|--------|------|
| `ghcr.io/sktelecom/bomlens` | Scanning and post-processing (canonical name) |
| `ghcr.io/sktelecom/sbom-generator`, `ghcr.io/sktelecom/sbom-scanner` | Aliases of the same image (former names, same digest) |
| `ghcr.io/sktelecom/bomlens-firmware` | Firmware analysis (includes GPL tools, opt-in) (legacy alias: sbom-scanner-firmware) |
| `ghcr.io/sktelecom/bomlens-deep-cve` | Bundles grype for deep CVE matching (opt-in). Used by the CLI's `--deep-cve` and by the web UI's Deep CVE matching toggle, both of which pull it automatically as a sibling container when it is not already the running image |

`latest` and version tags are available, and both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` are supported. Images are signed with cosign before publishing.

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/sktelecom/bomlens:latest
```

## What is in the image

It is a lightweight image (based on python 3.12 slim) without language toolchains. For source scans, transitive dependency resolution is handled by the script, which pulls per-language cdxgen images separately. See [Architecture](../concepts/architecture.md) for the structure.

| Tool | Version | Role |
|------|------|------|
| syft | v1.51.0 | Scans images, binaries, and directories |
| Trivy | v0.74.0 | Vulnerability report |
| cosign | v2.6.5 | SBOM signing |
| jq | — | SBOM normalization and notice generation |
| ScanCode Toolkit | 32.5.0 | Precise license detection (included only in opt-in builds) |

Tool versions are pinned with `ARG` in `docker/Dockerfile`.

## Running directly

Select the analysis mode with the `MODE` environment variable. All examples below leave their outputs in the current directory and do not upload anything (`UPLOAD_ENABLED=false`).

### Analyze a Docker image

On Git Bash (Windows), MSYS rewrites both `/var/run/docker.sock` and the
container-side `/host-output` into Windows paths before Docker ever sees
them, silently breaking both mounts. `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV` and
`MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL` below turn that rewriting off, and `cygpath -m`
converts the host side back by hand instead (`scripts/scan-sbom.sh` uses the
same pair for the same reason). WSL2, macOS and Linux shells don't rewrite
paths and skip straight to the plain `docker run` line.

<!-- runnable -->
```bash
HOSTPATH="$(cygpath -m "$(pwd)" 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*' docker run --rm \
  -v "$HOSTPATH":/host-output \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e MODE=IMAGE \
  -e TARGET_IMAGE="nginx:alpine" \
  -e UPLOAD_ENABLED=false \
  -e HOST_OUTPUT_DIR=/host-output \
  -e PROJECT_NAME="Nginx" \
  -e PROJECT_VERSION="alpine" \
  ghcr.io/sktelecom/bomlens:latest
```

### Analyze a binary file

```bash
HOSTPATH="$(cygpath -m "$(pwd)" 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*' docker run --rm \
  -v "$HOSTPATH":/target \
  -v "$HOSTPATH":/host-output \
  -e MODE=BINARY \
  -e TARGET_FILE=/target/firmware.bin \
  -e UPLOAD_ENABLED=false \
  -e HOST_OUTPUT_DIR=/host-output \
  -e PROJECT_NAME="Firmware" \
  -e PROJECT_VERSION="1.0" \
  ghcr.io/sktelecom/bomlens:latest
```

### Analyze a source directory

<!-- runnable -->
```bash
HOSTPATH="$(cygpath -m "$(pwd)" 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*' docker run --rm \
  -v "$HOSTPATH":/src \
  -v "$HOSTPATH":/host-output \
  -e MODE=SOURCE \
  -e UPLOAD_ENABLED=false \
  -e HOST_OUTPUT_DIR=/host-output \
  -e PROJECT_NAME="MyApp" \
  -e PROJECT_VERSION="1.0.0" \
  ghcr.io/sktelecom/bomlens:latest
```

In direct runs, `SOURCE` mode has syft read the package manifests inside the container, so it may only capture direct dependencies. If you need transitive dependencies, use `scan-sbom.sh`, which routes to the per-language cdxgen images.

### Notice and reports in one run

In direct runs, the notice and security reports are off by default. Turn on the following variables to get the same outputs as the CLI's `--all`.

<!-- runnable -->
```bash
HOSTPATH="$(cygpath -m "$(pwd)" 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL='*' docker run --rm \
  -v "$HOSTPATH":/host-output \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -e MODE=IMAGE \
  -e TARGET_IMAGE="nginx:alpine" \
  -e GENERATE_NOTICE=true \
  -e GENERATE_SECURITY=true \
  -e GENERATE_REPORT=true \
  -e UPLOAD_ENABLED=false \
  -e HOST_OUTPUT_DIR=/host-output \
  -e PROJECT_NAME="Nginx" \
  -e PROJECT_VERSION="alpine" \
  ghcr.io/sktelecom/bomlens:latest
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|--------|------|
| `MODE` | Yes | `POSTPROCESS` | Analysis mode: `SOURCE`, `IMAGE`, `BINARY`, `ROOTFS`, `FIRMWARE`, `ANALYZE` |
| `PROJECT_NAME` | Yes | — | Project name |
| `PROJECT_VERSION` | Yes | — | Project version |
| `TARGET_IMAGE` | Per mode | — | Image name for `IMAGE` mode (requires the docker.sock mount) |
| `TARGET_FILE` | Per mode | — | File path for `BINARY`/`FIRMWARE` mode (path inside the container) |
| `TARGET_DIR` | Per mode | — | Directory path for `ROOTFS` mode |
| `UPLOAD_ENABLED` | — | `true` | If `false`, save locally without uploading (same as CLI `--generate-only`) |
| `HOST_OUTPUT_DIR` | — | — | Mounted path to copy the outputs to |
| `GENERATE_NOTICE` | — | `false` | Generate the open-source notice (CLI `--notice`) |
| `GENERATE_SECURITY` | — | `false` | Generate the Trivy security report (CLI `--security`) |
| `GENERATE_REPORT` | — | `false` | Generate the open-source risk analysis report (off in direct runs, unlike the CLI default) |
| `ENRICH_MAVEN_CPE` | — | `true` | Attach an NVD-matchable `cpe:2.3` to maven components (derived from the groupId) so a CPE-aware engine can reach their NVD-only CVEs; unmapped groups get no CPE (skipped for AI SBOMs) |
| `ENRICH_GITHUB_CPE` | — | `true` | Attach an NVD-matchable `cpe:2.3` to a small, hand-verified set of `pkg:github/` components (source-repository-only coordinates, typical for large C/C++ projects with no package-manager ecosystem) so a CPE-aware engine can reach their NVD-only CVEs; anything not in the curated list gets no CPE (skipped for AI SBOMs) |
| `ENRICH_INTERPRETER_CPE` | — | `true` | Attach an NVD-matchable `cpe:2.3` to a small, hand-verified set of interpreter components (e.g. Python packaged as a conda or NuGet artifact) so a CPE-aware engine can reach their NVD-only CVEs; anything not in the curated list gets no CPE (skipped for AI SBOMs) |
| `SECURITY_NVD_VERIFY` | — | `false` | With `--deep-cve`: verify each grype `nvd:cpe` finding against the live NVD version range and drop out-of-range false positives (needs `NVD_API_KEY` + network; adds minutes). Off by default — findings are kept and flagged version-unverified |
| `NVD_API_KEY` | For `SECURITY_NVD_VERIFY` | — | NVD API key used by the deep-cve version filter; passed to the container by name only (never inlined) |
| `ENRICH_EOL` | — | `true` | Flag components past their upstream end-of-life from a bundled offline snapshot (skipped for AI SBOMs) |
| `ENRICH_MALICIOUS` | — | `true` | Flag components that are known-malicious packages (typosquats, hijacked accounts) from a bundled offline OSV snapshot. A separate signal from vulnerabilities: the response is removal and credential rotation, not an upgrade |
| `ENRICH_OS_CONTEXT` | — | `true` | Synthesize an `operating-system` component from distro package PURLs (rpm, deb, and apk). Trivy selects the distro vulnerability feed from that component, so without it the OS packages in a supplier SBOM or rootfs scan would get no OS CVE matches at all. No-op when the SBOM has no recognizable distro packages — including a distro Trivy carries no feed for, such as OpenWRT (skipped for AI SBOMs) |
| `STALENESS_ENRICH` | — | `false` | Add deps.dev version currency (how many releases behind latest); needs network access |
| `ENRICH_HF_SECURITY` | — | `true` | AIBOM mode: read HuggingFace's per-file security scan results (ClamAV + picklescan) into the ML-BOM; metadata only, no file download |
| `API_KEY`, `API_URL` | For uploads | — | Upload credential and server URL. DT uses `X-Api-Key`; TRUSCA uses a Bearer token |
| `UPLOAD_TARGET` | — | `dependency-track` | Upload destination: `dependency-track` (DT-compatible) or `trusca` (native ingest, not DT-compatible) |
| `TRUSCA_PROJECT_ID` | When `trusca` | — | Target TRUSCA project id (UUID). Must already exist (no auto-create) |
| `TRUSCA_REF` | — | `main` | Ingest ref label |
| `TRUSCA_RELEASE` | — | `PROJECT_VERSION` | Ingest release label |
| `BOMLENS_MAVEN_FULL_GRAPH` | — | — | Maven source scans: set `1` to keep the full resolved graph instead of filtering to compile/runtime scope |
| `BOMLENS_NODE_FULL_GRAPH` | — | — | Node.js source scans: set `1` to keep the full dev-plus-production graph instead of the production-only set |
| `BOMLENS_KEEP_BUILD_OUTPUT` | — | — | Source scans: set `1` to leave the resolved tree in place. By default the scan restores the files its resolvers rewrote (`go.mod`, `go.sum`, `Cargo.lock`, `Gemfile.lock`, `Package.resolved`) and removes the build directories they created, so the scanned project is handed back as it was |
| `CYCLONEDX_SPEC_VERSIONS` | — | `1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6` | Accepted CycloneDX spec versions for the conformance check (space-separated); overrides the default range |
| `AI_CYCLONEDX_SPEC_VERSIONS` | — | `1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7` | Accepted CycloneDX versions for AI SBOMs (ML-BOM), which additionally allow 1.7 |
| `SPDX_SPEC_VERSIONS` | — | `SPDX-2.2 SPDX-2.3` | Accepted SPDX spec versions for the conformance check |

> TRUSCA's (formerly TrustedOSS Portal) native ingest endpoint (`POST /v1/projects/{id}/sbom-ingest`, Bearer auth) is not Dependency-Track compatible. To push to a regular Dependency-Track server, keep `UPLOAD_TARGET=dependency-track` (the default).

## Building and publishing the image

The procedure for building the image yourself or publishing it for multiple platforms is in the contributor-facing [docker/README](https://github.com/sktelecom/bomlens/blob/main/docker/README.md).
