description: Reference for the BomLens web UI and desktop app — how to launch it, the shell layout, scan targets, and the result sections.

# Web UI & desktop app

Scan from a browser without the CLI. The UI server is built into the scanner image, so no extra install is needed.

![The BomLens New scan screen](../images/web-ui.png)

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
cd ~/sbom-output      # output folder (anywhere is fine)
/path/to/bomlens/scripts/scan-sbom.sh --ui
# → opens http://localhost:8080 automatically
```

**Windows — double-click (no command line):** in the unzipped folder, double-click `scripts\sbom-ui.bat` and a browser opens `http://localhost:8080` shortly after. Docker just needs to be running, and `sbom-ui.bat` works on Rancher Desktop or Docker Desktop (on WSL2, run `scan-sbom.sh --ui` inside WSL).

> The run location is the output base, and it scans that folder's source only when you choose "Current folder" as the scan target. If you use a GitHub URL, an upload, or a Docker image, the run location does not matter. Each scan is saved to its own `{Project}_{Version}/` subfolder; the base defaults and how to change them are in [Where outputs go](cli.md#where-outputs-go).

## The shell

The interface has a top bar across the width, a left rail for the current scan's sections, and a content area:

- **Top bar** — the product mark (links home), the current project, a Re-scan button (shown on a scan that still carries its settings, so you can re-run the same target with the toggles prefilled), global search across components and CVEs, the Scan management menu (the clock icon opens a list of past scans with a delete control and a link to the full list), the New scan button, and the language (KO / EN / TW) and light/dark toggles.
- **Left rail** — two named links out of the scan (Scan management, New scan) above the current scan's sections, which are grouped under Inventory, Security, Compliance, AI and Outputs. The rail adapts to the scan: AI sections appear only for AI/ML SBOMs, and a section appears only when its data exists. It collapses to icons on narrow windows. With no scan open — the home screen — there is no rail.
- **Content** — the home (Scan management) screen, the New scan form, the running view, or the active result section.

The global actions (New scan, Scan management) live in the top bar, and the rail repeats them as labelled links above its sections so a result screen always shows a named way back. Every navigation element — the logo, New scan, the rail sections, the jump cards and the past-scan links — is a real link backed by a URL hash (`#/scan/<id>/<section>`), so Cmd/Ctrl or middle click opens it in a new tab.

## New scan

The New scan screen is two panes. On the left, pick a source — grouped into Code (current folder, a directory path, a GitHub URL, a ZIP upload), Artifact (a Docker image, a package or build artifact, a firmware image), SBOM (analyze an existing SBOM) and AI model (generate an ML-BOM from a HuggingFace model, or from a model file you upload) — and fill in the source-specific input below the tiles. On the right, enter the project name and version, choose the outputs to generate, and start the scan.

| Scan target | Input method | Backend mode |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Current folder | scans the source in the UI's run folder | SOURCE |
| Directory path | a subfolder under the run folder (e.g. an OS rootfs), a folder mounted with `--ui --mount <dir>`, or — in the desktop app — a folder added with the Add folder button | ROOTFS, or ANALYZE when the folder is a [Yocto build directory](#yocto-build-directory) |
| GitHub URL | enter the repository URL | SOURCE (clone) |
| ZIP upload | upload a `.zip`/tar file | SOURCE (extract) |
| Package upload | upload a build artifact — `.jar`, `.war`, `.ear`, `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.whl` | BINARY (a wheel is unpacked and scanned as ROOTFS) |
| SBOM upload | upload an existing SBOM (JSON, or the `.spdx.tar.zst` a Yocto SPDX 2.2 build deploys) | ANALYZE |
| Firmware upload | upload a `.bin`, etc. | FIRMWARE |
| Docker image | enter the image name | IMAGE |
| AI model | enter a HuggingFace model id (`org/model`) | AIBOM |
| Model file | upload a `.gguf`, `.safetensors`, `.pt`, … (up to 8 GB) | MODELFILE |
| Published dataset | enter a Figshare item — its page URL, its DOI, or the item number — in the same field as the model id | DATASET |

Generation options are the open-source notice and the security (vulnerability) report. A scan always writes the SBOM in CycloneDX; an SPDX copy is exported afterwards from the results screen, so there is nothing to decide here. Separately, an **Advanced scan options** section gathers the toggles that change how the source is analyzed rather than which files are produced. License scan (ScanCode) scans the project's own source files for per-file license text (1st-party; it does not download the declared dependencies) and applies to source-code scans (current folder, GitHub URL, ZIP upload). File-level identification (SCANOSS) finds third-party open source copied into the tree (mainly C/C++), also for source-code scans. For firmware, the advanced option is OSV advisories. SCANOSS uses the free OSSKB service, which is rate-limited and may return nothing under frequent use, so add a token from scanoss.com for regular runs. Docker images, SBOM uploads and AI models have no advanced options. Choosing SBOM upload (ANALYZE) forces the notice and security reports on for the risk analysis, and an AI-model scan produces the notice only (it has no package CVEs, so the security report is skipped).

A **Reproducible output** toggle produces byte-identical SBOMs across runs (the UI equivalent of `--byte-stable`); it is available for source, image and firmware scans, not for SBOM analysis or AI models.

An **Outbound license** field takes the SPDX id your project ships under, such as `Apache-2.0` (the UI equivalent of `--license`). Fill it in and the Licenses section reports which dependencies clash with it; leave it empty and that check stays off, which the section says outright. It appears wherever BomLens generates the SBOM, so not for an analyzed supplier SBOM (which carries the supplier's own declaration) or an AI model.

Below the outputs, an optional **Upload** step can send the finished SBOM to a server. Turn it on to pick the destination — Dependency-Track or TRUSCA — and enter the server URL and an access token; TRUSCA also asks for the target project id. The URL and token are used for that one run and are never saved. It is the UI equivalent of the CLI upload options; see [Upload to Dependency-Track / TRUSCA](../guides/upload.md).

### Yocto build directory

A folder picked with the Directory input can be a Yocto build directory, and BomLens recognizes it as one: it analyzes the image SBOM the build published under `tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/` instead of walking the build tree, which holds sysroots and native build tools that never ship in the image. The scan log names the folder and the document it read, the result page labels the scan a Yocto build directory, and the vulnerabilities carry the verdicts the build itself made — patched by a recipe, judged not applicable, or still open.

The build gives the most when it was configured to emit an SBOM (`INHERIT += "create-spdx-3.0"` and `INHERIT += "vex"` in `conf/local.conf`, on 5.0 Scarthgap or later — 4.0 Kirkstone has no such class). SPDX 2.2 is read as well, together with the `.spdx.tar.zst` beside it, though it carries no CVE verdicts; a build with no SPDX at all is read from the manifests it wrote anyway. Only a build directory with none of those stops the scan, rather than falling back to a directory scan whose result would misrepresent the image. The [supplier SBOM guide](../guides/supplier-sbom.md#yocto-images) covers the behaviour and its limits; the CLI recognizes the same folder through `--target`.

## Scan running

During a run the screen shows the pipeline stages — generate, normalize, notices, security, report — advancing as the live log streams, so you can see where the scan is and read any error (clone failure, no Docker socket, an unsupported file) as it happens.

## Result sections

When the scan finishes, the left rail fills with the sections for that scan.

**Overview** opens by naming what was scanned — the folder path, the cloned URL, the container image reference, the uploaded file's name, or the AI model id — so a result read weeks later still says where its numbers came from. Then come the at-a-glance counts as cards that jump to each detail section, then what needs attention — known-malicious packages first, then a failed format conformance (for an analyzed supplier SBOM), critical or high vulnerabilities, and components flagged for license review. A malicious package leads because it is already running in the build and has to be removed, not scheduled for a patch. When the scan flags components past their upstream end-of-life, an "End of life" count tile joins the cards, with the ones that are also vulnerable shown in the risk colour (see [Component end-of-life](../concepts/reports-explained.md#component-end-of-life-eol)). A separate tile counts the components that have fallen behind their latest version (see [Version currency](../concepts/reports-explained.md#version-currency)). Below that, two risk axes sit side by side: the security severity distribution and the license classification. Click a band in either and you land in that section (Vulnerabilities or Licenses) with the filter already applied.

If a scan finished with reduced analysis — for example cdxgen ran out of Docker disk space and the SBOM fell back to direct dependencies only — a banner here gives the reason and what to do. If a scan is still running, its live log appears here on the Overview, not under every section.

![Overview — needs-attention, counts, severity and jump cards](../images/app-results.png)

**Components** lists everything detected, with search and filters (has vulnerabilities, direct only, needs review, end of life, outdated) and columns for Scope (direct vs transitive) and Risk (the worst vulnerability severity and count). A component the bundled OSV snapshot knows to be a malicious package carries a "Malicious package" badge, ahead of the others, with the advisory id and snapshot date in its tooltip. A component past its upstream end-of-life carries an "End of life" badge, with the EOL date where known. A component that is not on its latest version is marked as outdated; with deps.dev enrichment on (`STALENESS_ENRICH=true`) its detail shows how many releases it is behind and its last-release date (see [Version currency](../concepts/reports-explained.md#version-currency)). Large SBOMs render in pages. Click a row to expand its detail in place — the PURL, source/download location, copyright, licenses and any vulnerabilities. Where the detail reports vulnerabilities, it also links into the Vulnerabilities section filtered to that component, and a vulnerability's own detail links back to its package in Components, so an investigation moves between the two lists without retyping the name.

![Components — Scope and Risk columns with filters](../images/web-ui-components.png)

**Vulnerabilities** sorts by severity then CVSS, with a CVSS column and the fixed version, and each row expands in place to show the CVSS vector, description and references. Click a band in the severity bar to filter to that severity, or search by CVE or package.

![Vulnerabilities — CVSS column and expandable rows](../images/web-ui-vulns.png)

**Dependencies** shows the relationships recorded in the SBOM as a graph or a tree. Direct dependencies are highlighted and packages with known vulnerabilities are marked with their severity. Switch to the tree to expand direct and transitive dependencies as a hierarchy.

![Dependencies — direct and vulnerable packages marked](../images/web-ui-dependencies.png)

**Licenses** opens with a license classification axis that groups components by copyleft strength — network copyleft (AGPL), strong copyleft (GPL), weak copyleft (LGPL, MPL, EPL, …), permissive, review needed, and uncategorized. An unrecognised license is never assumed permissive; it falls to uncategorized so a person looks at it. Click a class to filter the rest of the section to it. Under the classification is the per-license distribution — how many components declare each license, busiest first, with the unlicensed bucket at the end. Picking a class narrows this list; clicking a license opens the Components table filtered to it, where it combines with the type, scope and risk filters. Below the distribution, when the scan declared an outbound license, come the dependencies whose terms clash with it — grouped worst first, each with the reasoning for its verdict. It is a documentation aid, not a legal determination. If no outbound license was declared the section says the check did not run and how to turn it on, rather than leaving an empty list to read as an all-clear. Then come the components whose terms need human review — AI behavioral-use (RAIL/Llama/Gemma) and non-commercial licenses.

![Licenses — the classification axis and outbound-license conflicts](../images/web-ui-licenses.png)

**SBOM conformance** appears when you analyze an existing SBOM (the SBOM upload / ANALYZE mode), under Risk & compliance. An intro line says what the section measures: how well the SBOM meets the format and submission requirements — the regulatory crosswalk shown with it is for reference and makes no compliance determination. It shows the format verdict — pass or fail — and the base CycloneDX checks (timestamp, tools, top-level component, name and version coverage, PURL coverage, transitive dependencies), with the missing items listed for each failed check, plus a crosswalk roll-up of how the checks map to the regulatory baselines (EU CRA via BSI TR-03183-2, the US SBOM minimum elements of 2026). When the analyzed SBOM carries a machine-learning-model component, the G7 AI minimum-element checks (all advisory) appear here as a sub-block, grouped by the seven G7 clusters and tagged by data source — auto (read directly), inferred, declared, or review-needed when no automated source exists. The [AI model SBOM guide](../guides/ai-model.md#reading-the-conformance-report) explains the headline numbers and badges.

![Conformance — format verdict with the G7 advisory sub-block](../images/web-ui-g7.png)

**Artifacts** lists the generated files (SBOM, notice, risk report, security report, conformance) grouped by kind, downloadable per format or as a single ZIP.

**Source tree** shows what the scan actually looked at, rather than only what it found. The tree on the left lists the files; picking one opens its text beside it. It appears for every scan that had files to read: a source scan, a directory or rootfs scan, a firmware image (after unpacking), a container image, and a build artifact that is an archive (jar, war, whl, zip, tar). A container image and an archive have no folder to walk, so BomLens unpacks a temporary copy, reads it, and deletes it before the scan ends. Symlinks are listed with the path they point at — in a container image nearly every command in `/bin` is a link into busybox, and leaving them out would show a tree in which those commands do not exist. When the scan ran with **License scan (ScanCode)** on, each file also carries the license detected in it.

The captured text is bounded so a scan's output folder stays a reasonable size: text files only, up to 256 KB each and 8 MB in total, and licence texts and package manifests are taken first so the evidence behind a finding is the part that survives a tight budget. A file with no text on screen says why — it is binary, or the capture reached its limit — and the line above the tree reports how many files were captured and how many were left out. Nothing is silently dropped.

**Submitted SBOM** appears when the scan read an SBOM someone else produced (SBOM upload / ANALYZE). Every other screen describes the CycloneDX document BomLens converted that input into, so this one describes the input itself: the format and spec version it was written in, its document name and identifier, when it was created, the tool that produced it, and the supplier or authors it names. Fields the supplier did not fill in are left out rather than shown blank — on a compliance screen a confident-looking wrong value costs more than a missing one. The entries themselves are not repeated here; the section links to Components, which lists them with sorting, filters and risk.

![Artifacts — files grouped by kind, with the SPDX export button on the SBOM card](../images/web-ui-artifacts.png)

The SBOM card in that section carries an **Export as SPDX 2.3** button. It converts the finished CycloneDX BOM into `{Project}_{Version}_bom.spdx.json` and starts the download at once, without rescanning. The converted file then joins the card as an ordinary download chip and is included in the ZIP, and the button is no longer offered for a scan that already has an SPDX file. CycloneDX stays the primary format, and CycloneDX-only data (vulnerabilities, `bomlens:*` properties) is not carried over. Signing is available only in the CLI (`--spdx --sign`), so a file exported here is unsigned like every other artifact the UI produces.

Conversion needs syft. The scanner image ships it, so the usual deployment converts on the spot. Where it is missing, such as the desktop app's base UI image, BomLens runs the scanner image as a separate container to do the conversion, which downloads that image once on first use. Where neither is possible, the button is not shown.

### AI surfaces

For an AI/ML SBOM (a CycloneDX SBOM with a machine-learning-model component), the rail adds:

**Models & datasets** — each model card's identifier, architecture, task, license, supplier and integrity, a four-axis disclosure panel (weights / architecture / training data / training process, as documented in the BOM), and the datasets the model references. When the SBOM carries a model risk assessment, the card opens with the overall grade badge (ok / conditional / caution / review), the per-axis verdicts (license, file security, datasets — an unevaluated axis shows a dash), the reasons behind the grade, the quoted custom-license wording and lineage warning when present, and the usage scenario the verdict was judged for; each dataset row carries its own grade badge. The section ends with the reminder that the assessment is guidance, not legal advice. For AI model scans, the New scan form adds a usage-context selector (internal / product / redistribute / outputs-only) that tailors this assessment.

![Models & datasets — model card and disclosure axes](../images/web-ui-models.png)

The G7 AI minimum-element checks appear inside the **SBOM conformance** section above — they are added only when the SBOM has a model component.

That section also shows an AI compliance profile card: a one-glance rollup of the G7 result, the number of license-flagged components, and regulatory framework coverage (EU AI Act, Korea AI Basic Act). It is advisory, not a certification, and the same data is written to the `_ai-profile` files (see [Artifacts](artifacts.md)).

## Scan management

The home screen — opened from the rail's Scan management link, the logo, or the top bar's Scan management (clock) menu — lists every past scan saved on this machine. Each scan's `{Project}_{Version}/` subfolder under the output base is one entry. A search box and scan-type filter chips (only the types that exist — Source, Container, RootFS, Firmware, AI model, SBOM) narrow the list. The type comes from what the scan was pointed at and, where that leaves it open, from the root component the SBOM declares — an analyzed supplier document reads as SBOM rather than as the Source its root usually claims to be. Three summary cards show the total scans, how many are at risk (click that card to filter to them), and the project count. The table sorts by scan, generated time, components or top severity. Click a row to re-open its results, or delete one to remove its subfolder — a prompt confirms first, because the files are removed from disk and nothing is kept to restore. This is local files only — no account, no database.

## External lookup

Reachable from the top bar's icon at any time, or from a Cmd/Ctrl+K search whose term looks like an advisory id — with or without a scan loaded. Type a CVE/GHSA/GO/PYSEC/RUSTSEC/OSV/GSD/MAL id, a purl, or a bare package name (which then asks for an ecosystem and version), and the server checks it live against OSV.dev: full detail for one advisory, or every known vulnerability for one package version. The URL (`#/lookup?q=…`) is a shareable link that re-runs the same lookup on open.

This is the one feature that reaches outside the machine on its own initiative rather than as part of a scan — see [Local-first by design](../concepts/local-first.md) for what that means for a closed network. Set `EXTERNAL_LOOKUP=false` to remove it (the icon, the search row and the screen) entirely.

## Notes

> The firmware upload tile appears automatically whenever the Docker engine is running. See the
> [firmware guide](../guides/firmware.md) for how it works and how to point it at a different image tag.
>
> **Note:** the UI's source scan (current folder / ZIP / GitHub) analyzes the directory with syft inside the container. Components are captured only when there is a lock file (`package-lock.json`, `go.sum`, and so on) or installed dependencies. If you only have a manifest and need deeper resolution, use the CLI source mode (cdxgen).

**Changing the port / on a conflict:** if the default port (8080) is taken by another service, specify a different port:
```bash
UI_PORT=9090 ./scripts/scan-sbom.sh --ui      # http://localhost:9090
```

**Reaching the UI from another machine:** the UI is published to the loopback interface, so it answers only on the machine that started it. It runs scans through the engine socket, which is why it is not offered to the network by default. If you do need it elsewhere, set the bind address and put an authenticating proxy in front of it:
```bash
UI_BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0 ./scripts/scan-sbom.sh --ui
```

> **Note:** even though the UI is easy, a Docker engine must be installed and running (free: WSL2 + docker-ce, or Rancher Desktop). The launcher detects a missing or stopped Docker and shows the install link.
