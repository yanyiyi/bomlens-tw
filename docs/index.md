# Generate SBOMs and assess open-source risk, all locally

A local-first SBOM generator and open-source risk assessor for a single project — no SaaS, no account. From source code, a container image, a binary, firmware, an SBOM you received, or a HuggingFace AI model, it produces an [SBOM](concepts/what-is-sbom.md) (CycloneDX 1.6), an open-source notice, and a security risk report in one run. For an AI model it builds a CycloneDX ML-BOM and checks it against the [G7 minimum elements for AI](guides/ai-model.md), whose clusters overlap with the EU AI Act's Annex IV.

The Windows installer needs a Docker engine already running; see the [no-CLI quick start](start/no-cli.md) below.

Want to see what a result looks like before installing anything? The [live demo](https://bomlens.ospo.tw/demo/) is the real web UI holding one finished scan of each kind: a Spring Boot project from source, a container image, a device firmware image, an AI model as a CycloneDX ML-BOM, and a supplier SBOM checked against the format requirements. Nothing to install, and nothing is uploaded: it is a frozen copy of results produced by ordinary local runs.

Prefer no command line? Download the installer and double-click it. A Docker engine is required; the free [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) works well on Windows. A step-by-step walkthrough is in the [no-CLI quick start](start/no-cli.md).
