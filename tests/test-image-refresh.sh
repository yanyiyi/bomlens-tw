# test-image-refresh.sh — No-Docker unit tests for scan-sbom.sh's image
# freshness check (SBOM_PULL / ensure_image_fresh).
#
# The defect this guards: `docker run` only auto-pulls an image that is
# entirely ABSENT locally; once a floating tag like `:latest` has been pulled
# once, it is reused forever even after the registry publishes a newer image.
# A stale cached ghcr.io/sktelecom/bomlens:latest predated
# docker/lib/scan-figshare.py, and a real scan failed with "python3: can't
# open file scan-figshare.py" until someone thought to `docker pull` by hand.
#
# The functions are lifted out of scan-sbom.sh rather than re-implemented, so
# this tests the shipping code. `docker` itself is a stub script (no daemon,
# no network), driven by files this test drops under $WORK before each case.

#   present     — touch to make `image inspect` report the image is local
#   pull-mode   — up-to-date | progress | stall | fail (default: up-to-date)
# Every invocation is appended to docker-calls.log so a case can assert
# whether `pull` was attempted at all (SBOM_PULL=missing on an absent image
# must never call it, and SBOM_PULL=never must not either).
