# test-ios.sh — regression tests for iOS lockfile coverage (CocoaPods; SPM is
# covered by cdxgen's offline Package.resolved support and needs no fixture here).
#
# Guards the defect where a CocoaPods project produced an EMPTY SBOM: cdxgen's swift
# language image has no `pod` CLI, so its CocoaPods cataloger yields zero components.
# BomLens fills the gap in post-processing by parsing Podfile.lock with syft.
#
# Two layers:
#   (1) No-Docker (always runs in CI): merge a canned cocoapods SBOM into an empty scan
#       via merge-sbom.sh, asserting the pods (incl. transitive) land with provenance.
#   (2) Docker (skipped when unavailable): identify-cocoapods.sh runs syft on a real
#       Podfile.lock and must return the full transitive set, offline, with no `pod`.
