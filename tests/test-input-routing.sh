# test-input-routing.sh — No-Docker unit tests for how scan-sbom.sh decides what
# an archive actually holds.
#
# The defect these guard: an archive was routed by extension alone, so a root
# filesystem shipped as a .zip and a `docker save` .tar were both extracted and
# scanned as source. Neither has a manifest to read, so both reported nothing
# while a binary scanner found dozens of components in the same bytes.
#
# The helpers are lifted out of scan-sbom.sh rather than re-implemented, so this
# tests the shipping code. Extraction is by function name, from the `name() {`
# line to the first line that is exactly `}`.
