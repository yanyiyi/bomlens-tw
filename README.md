<h1 align="center">BomLens</h1>

> **BomLens** is a local-first [SBOM](https://sktelecom.github.io/bomlens/concepts/what-is-sbom/) generator and open-source risk assessor. It produces a CycloneDX SBOM, an open-source notice, and a security and license risk report for a single project in seconds — from source code, a container, a binary, firmware, an SBOM you received, or a HuggingFace AI model. CLI or browser UI, no SaaS.

Try it without installing anything: the [live demo](https://sktelecom.github.io/bomlens/demo/) is the real web UI holding finished scan results. To run your own scans, download the installer for [Windows](https://github.com/sktelecom/bomlens/releases/latest/download/BomLens-Setup.exe) or [macOS](https://github.com/sktelecom/bomlens/releases/latest/download/BomLens-Setup.dmg), or go straight to the [CLI](#cli-advanced).

The demo at [sktelecom.github.io/bomlens/demo](https://sktelecom.github.io/bomlens/demo/) holds one finished scan of each kind: a Spring Boot project from source, a container image (1,393 components), a Raspberry Pi OS device image unpacked as firmware, an AI model as a CycloneDX ML-BOM checked against the G7 minimum elements, and a supplier SBOM checked against the format requirements. Read-only, nothing to install, and nothing is uploaded — it is a frozen copy of results from ordinary local runs.

## What it does

One Docker image, two jobs. It **generates**: scan your source code, a container image, or a binary and get a CycloneDX SBOM, an open-source notice, and a security report. It also **assesses open-source risk** in what you receive — a supplier's finished SBOM (`--analyze`) or a firmware binary — reporting licenses and known vulnerabilities with Critical-7d / High-30d remediation deadlines. Every scan emits the risk report by default. Originally built by SK Telecom for supply-chain security, now open source.

Languages: Java, Python, Node.js, Ruby, PHP, Rust, Go, .NET, Swift, C/C++ (Conan/vcpkg, or `--identify-vendored` when there is no package manager), Modelica (`annotation(uses(...))` only — the libraries a `.mo` file directly declares, no lockfile or transitive resolution). Inputs: a source folder, a GitHub URL, a ZIP archive, a Docker image, a binary or RootFS, an existing SBOM, a Yocto build directory, firmware, a HuggingFace AI model (CycloneDX ML-BOM checked against the [G7 minimum elements for AI](https://sktelecom.github.io/bomlens/guides/ai-model/), which map to the EU AI Act's Annex IV), an AI model file read offline from its own header (GGUF, safetensors, PyTorch, ONNX and more), or a published research dataset from a Figshare item.

The project is under active development at SK Telecom's open source program office. Releases go out every week or two, and every change runs through CI covering ShellCheck, the scanner integration tests, the web UI contract tests, and a per-language check of the ten example projects.

## Quick Start

Everything runs on a Docker engine (20.10+). The desktop app and web UI manage the image for you; only the CLI asks you to pull it. On Windows, free [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) or WSL2 + docker-ce works well; Docker Desktop also works, with licensing caveats for larger organizations.

### Desktop app — no command line (recommended)

Download the installer and double-click it: [BomLens-Setup.exe](https://github.com/sktelecom/bomlens/releases/latest/download/BomLens-Setup.exe) for Windows or [BomLens-Setup.dmg](https://github.com/sktelecom/bomlens/releases/latest/download/BomLens-Setup.dmg) for macOS. It checks Docker, pulls the image, and opens the UI — no console window. The app is unsigned for now; if Windows SmartScreen or macOS blocks it, the [no-CLI quick start](docs/start/no-cli.md) ([한국어](docs/start/no-cli.ko.md)) shows how to proceed. Build details are in [`electron/`](electron/README.md).

![BomLens web UI — name a project, pick a scan target, and choose what to generate (SBOM, open-source notice, security report)](docs/images/web-ui-en.png)

### Web UI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sktelecom/bomlens.git && cd bomlens
./scripts/scan-sbom.sh --ui     # opens http://localhost:8080; results save to the current folder
#   Windows: double-click scripts\sbom-ui.bat
```

Enter a project name and version, pick a scan target (current folder, GitHub URL, ZIP, SBOM, firmware upload, or Docker image), click Run scan, then view or download the results; live logs stream as it runs. To scan a folder outside the launch directory, add `--mount <dir>` (repeatable, or `--mount /` for the whole host); the desktop app has an Add folder button for the same.

### CLI (advanced)

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/sktelecom/bomlens:latest   # aliases: sbom-generator and sbom-scanner serve the same image
./scripts/scan-sbom.sh --project MyApp --version 1.0.0 --target examples/nodejs --all --generate-only
```

On Windows, run the same command through `scripts\scan-sbom.bat` (Git for Windows required). Outputs land in a `{Project}_{Version}/` subfolder, prefixed `{Project}_{Version}_…`: `bom.json` (SBOM), `NOTICE.{txt,html}`, `risk-report.{md,html}`, and `security.{json,md,html}`; add `--spdx` for an SPDX 2.3 copy. Other inputs and every option are in the [CLI reference](docs/reference/cli.md) and the [input-scenarios guide](docs/guides/by-input.md).
