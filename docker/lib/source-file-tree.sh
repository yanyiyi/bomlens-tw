# source-file-tree.sh — emit a ScanCode-shaped file inventory for the source view.
#
# Usage: source-file-tree.sh <source_dir> <out_file>
#
# The web UI's source-tree panel parses ScanCode output (`_scancode.json`), but
# ScanCode (deep-license) is opt-in and off by default, so most scans show no
# tree even though the scanned files are right there. This walks the scanned
# source directory and writes the SAME `{"files":[{"path","type"}, …]}` shape
# ScanCode emits — just without license fields — so the frontend's parseScanCode
# consumes it unchanged and the tree shows structure with empty license columns.
#
# Paths are relative to the source root (no leading "/"), matching ScanCode.
# Common noise (.git, node_modules, build outputs) is excluded and the entry
# count is capped so a giant tree can't bloat the artifact; truncation is logged
# (never silent). Best-effort: any failure leaves no file and never breaks a scan.
