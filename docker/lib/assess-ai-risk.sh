# assess-ai-risk.sh — stamp every machine-learning-model and data component
# with a usability verdict (bomlens:assessment:*) derived from the curated
# license-terms registry (ai-risk-knowledge.json). Offline, pure
# post-processing: it reads nothing but the SBOM and the registry, so it runs
# after normalize-sbom.sh (SPDX ids in place) and before validate-sbom.sh.
#
# Verdicts: ok | conditional | caution | review, worst-of ranked
# caution > review > conditional > ok — a known blocker outranks an unknown,
# an unknown outranks known-conditional (the same "never read unknown as safe"
# rule as bomlens:licenseClass). A license the registry does not know falls to
# review, never to a guess. Later axes (file security, dataset signals) append
# to bomlens:assessment:axes; overall is the worst verdict across the axes
# that were actually evaluated.
#
# The verdict is guidance, not legal advice — every report that prints it must
# carry the registry's disclaimer. Idempotent: previous bomlens:assessment:*
# properties are dropped and re-appended at a fixed position, so re-runs and
# --byte-stable output stay byte-identical.
#
