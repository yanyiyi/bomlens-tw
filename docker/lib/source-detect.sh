# source-detect.sh — shared language detection + cdxgen image selection.
#
# Sourced by BOTH scripts/scan-sbom.sh (host CLI) and docker/entrypoint.sh
# (web UI source scan inside the scanner image). Keeping the logic here means
# the CLI and the UI pick the same cdxgen language image, so a source scan
# resolves transitive dependencies identically on both paths.
#
# Defaults use ${VAR:-default} so a caller that already exported these (the CLI)
# keeps its values; a caller that did not (the UI) gets the defaults.
