# license_class — copyleft-strength classification (bomlens:licenseClass).
#
# MIRROR of the web UI classifier in
# docker/web/frontend/src/lib/licenses.ts (licenseRiskTier + TIER_RANK): the
# same permissive allowlist, the same tier patterns in the same order, and the
# same worst-of precedence, so the SBOM property, the risk report and the UI
# badge never disagree. tests/test-postprocess.sh diffs the id sets and
# patterns of the two files, so a change on either side without the matching
# change on the other fails CI.
#
# The headline rule (same as the UI): an unrecognised license is NEVER assumed
# permissive — it falls to "uncategorized" (a human must look). Orthogonal to
# license_flag above: a component can carry both bomlens:licenseClass and
# bomlens:licenseReview.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Known permissive SPDX ids (uppercased). An allowlist, not a heuristic — keep
# in sync with the PERMISSIVE set in licenses.ts (single line: the drift guard
# extracts the quoted ids from this def).
def permissive_ids: ["MIT","MIT-0","ISC","0BSD","BSD-2-CLAUSE","BSD-3-CLAUSE","APACHE-2.0","APACHE-1.1","ZLIB","UNLICENSE","BSL-1.0","PSF-2.0","PYTHON-2.0","CC0-1.0","WTFPL","NCSA","X11"];

# Classify ONE license id/name/expression. Order matters: AGPL and LGPL are
# matched before the bare GPL test so they don't fall to strong-copyleft, and a
# GPL carrying an exception clause is matched before it too. That clause exists
# precisely to permit linking the bare license would forbid (the classpath
# exception on jakarta/javax APIs and OpenJDK is the common one), so labelling it
# strong-copyleft warns about an obligation the component does not impose. The
# GPL prefix keeps the test narrow: "Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception" is permissive
# and must not be pulled up into copyleft by the word WITH alone.
#
# Creative Commons (datasets and AI models carry these, not software licenses):
# the axis here is copyleft strength, not content-licensing terms in general, so
# only the one CC clause with a copyleft-like effect matters — Share-Alike, which
# obligates a derivative to carry the same license, the same way LGPL/MPL do for
# modified files. CC-BY-SA is matched before the bare CC-BY test for the same
# reason AGPL/LGPL precede GPL: the more specific pattern first. Plain CC-BY (and
# CC-BY-NC, CC-BY-ND) impose attribution or a field-of-use limit but never
# propagate the license, so they land on permissive for THIS axis — a
# non-commercial restriction is a real limitation, but flagging it is
# license_flag's job (bomlens:licenseReview), not this one's; CC-BY-NC is
# already caught there. CC-BY-ND is not, and neither axis currently says so.

# SPDX expression parsing (bomlens:licenseConflict).
#
# MIRROR of parseLicenseExpression in licenses.ts; tests/test-postprocess.sh
# diffs the operator patterns of the two files.
#
# Why a parser at all: a component's license arrives in two different shapes —
# several entries in `licenses[]`, or ONE string holding an SPDX expression
# ("MIT OR Apache-2.0", "EPL-2.0 AND GPL-2.0-with-classpath-exception"). OR and
# AND mean opposite things for a conflict verdict: OR lets the consumer pick one
# (so one compatible choice clears it), AND applies every term at once (so one
# bad term condemns it). license_class above deliberately ignores the operators
# and takes the worst term — safe for a strength label, wrong for a verdict.
#
# Scope: flat expressions only. Parentheses are NOT parsed — a nested expression
# yields no terms and the caller records "unknown" rather than guessing. AND
# binds tighter than OR (per the SPDX spec), which falls out of splitting on OR
# first and then on AND.
#
# Shape: [[term, …], …] — a list of OR alternatives, each a list of AND terms.
#   "MIT OR Apache-2.0"      -> [["MIT"], ["Apache-2.0"]]
#   "EPL-1.0 AND LGPL-2.1"   -> [["EPL-1.0", "LGPL-2.1"]]
#   "(A OR B) AND C"         -> []            (parenthesised: not parsed)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# A slash is the other OR spelling seen in the wild ("MIT/X11"). Only treated as
# an operator when there is exactly one and the string carries no URL scheme, so
# a license *name* holding a link is never chopped in half.
