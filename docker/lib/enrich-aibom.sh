# enrich-aibom.sh — post-generation enrichment for an AI SBOM (CycloneDX 1.7
# ML-BOM). Fills fields the OWASP AIBOM Generator leaves empty but that the G7
# minimum elements call for, from sources it does not consult:
#
#   1. Model integrity hashes   — the HuggingFace API exposes a SHA-256 for every
#                                 LFS-tracked weight file (info.siblings[].lfs.sha256).
#                                 No generator writes these; we read and inject them.
#   2. Model openness (4 axes)  — derived from HF signals (gated/private, weight
#                                 files, declared datasets, training docs) and
#                                 written as openness:* properties. Grounded in the
#                                 Model Openness Framework (arXiv 2403.13784).
#   3. Referenced datasets      — the model card names its training datasets and
#                                 says nothing else about them. Each id is resolved
#                                 against the datasets API into a CycloneDX `data`
#                                 component (license, upstream, content digests)
#                                 linked to the model through dependencies[].
#   4. Pedigree / performance   — harvested from `cdxgen -t ai` when that tool is
#                                 present (it fills model ancestors, performance
#                                 metrics, and cdx:huggingface:* properties the
#                                 OWASP tool omits), merged into the model component.
#
# All steps are best-effort: no network, no huggingface_hub, or no cdxgen simply
# skips that step, leaving the field unfilled so the G7 conformance report shows
# it honestly as "not present" rather than fabricated. Non-LFS files carry only a
# git SHA-1 (not a content SHA-256), so only LFS weight files get a hash here.
#
# Auth contract: HF_TOKEN, when present in the environment, is read implicitly by
# huggingface_hub, which is what lets a private or gated repo enrich. We pass no
# explicit token argument — keeping it out of argv and out of exception text is
# the point. Never print the value.
#
# Usage: enrich-aibom.sh <sbom.json> <hf_model_id>

# describes a generator run that happens to contain a model. Everything that reads
# an SBOM as "one subject plus its parts" then reads it wrong: the 2026 minimum
# elements score the job as a component with no licence and no hash, the
# dependency root points at an id nothing in the document defines, and the web UI
# had to special-case the job name out of its scan list.
#
# So the model is promoted to the subject and the job is dropped. Nothing is lost:
# the generator is already named in metadata.tools, and the job id was a
# timestamp. Only a generator-shaped document is rewritten — a model already at
# the root is left exactly as it is.
