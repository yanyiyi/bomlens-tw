    socket — the same sibling pattern entrypoint.sh uses for cdxgen language
    images. The sibling runs the FULL run-scan pipeline (generate + normalize +
    notice + security + sign) with MODE set, writing finished artifacts straight
    into the run's output dir, which is under THIS container's OUTPUT_DIR. So the
    base container just streams the sibling's log and then summarizes the
    artifacts exactly as it does for an in-process scan.

    Sharing is by --volumes-from THIS container, NOT by host-path bind mounts: a
    host path (e.g. a Windows drive path C:/…) cannot be consumed by the
    in-container Linux docker CLI (the ':' splits the -v spec), which silently
    broke firmware/AI on Windows. --volumes-from replays the daemon's already
    resolved OUTPUT_DIR mount, so both `out_dir` and `upload_file` (both container
    paths under OUTPUT_DIR) are visible at the same paths on every host OS.
      out_dir      the run's output dir (HOST_OUTPUT_DIR / -w; == run_out)
      upload_file  the firmware/binary upload or an uploaded/found SBOM, read in
                   place as TARGET_FILE / ANALYZE_SBOM
      source_root  a source tree to scan, read in place as SOURCE_ROOT  [SOURCE, deep-cve only]
      target_dir   a directory to scan, read in place as TARGET_DIR    [ROOTFS, deep-cve only]
      target_image a container image reference, forwarded as TARGET_IMAGE (not a
                   path — validated against _REF_RE, not containment)  [IMAGE, deep-cve only]
    The host socket is mounted so the firmware image can, in turn, do its own
    work; AIBOM needs only outbound network (HuggingFace); the deep-cve modes
    (SOURCE/IMAGE/ROOTFS/BINARY) need it too, since a SOURCE scan launches its
    own cdxgen-language sibling in turn.

    Returns the sibling's exit code, or -1 if docker could not be invoked.
    Streams every line (docker pull progress + scan log) through on_log so the
    SSE UX is identical to an in-process scan.
