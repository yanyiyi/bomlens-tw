# build-demo-bundle.sh — build the web UI as the read-only demo and place it
# where MkDocs will pick it up (docs/demo/).
#
# The demo is the same SPA as the app, built with two settings: a base path,
# because the site lives under /bomlens/, and a data base, which switches the
# API layer from "call the server" to "read the captured JSON" (lib/demo.ts).
# The captured JSON itself is committed under docs/demo/data/ and produced by
# scripts/capture-demo-data.sh — this script never touches it.
#
# The bundle is deliberately NOT committed: CI runs this before `mkdocs build`,
# and mkdocs copies docs/demo/ into the site as-is.
#
# Usage: scripts/build-demo-bundle.sh
#   DEMO_BASE_PATH   URL path the site is served from (default /bomlens/demo/)
#   DEMO_DATA_BASE   URL path of the captured data (default /bomlens/demo/data)
