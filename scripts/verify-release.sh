# verify-release.sh — gate a release before it is shown to users.
#
# A first-time visitor follows the release's two recommended entry points: the
# one-click desktop installer, and `docker pull` + the documented first-scan
# command. Those artifacts are produced by separate workflows (desktop.yml,
# docker-publish.yml) that finish after the release is created, so this script
# confirms both are actually ready and working for THIS release:
#   1. BomLens-Setup.exe and .dmg are attached to the release.
#   2. The published scanner image for this version is pullable.
#   3. The documented first-scan command produces a valid SBOM on that exact
#      published image (not a CI-built one).
#
# It only verifies (no publish/side effects), so the release-gate job can run it
# while the release is still a draft, and it can be dry-run on demand against an
# existing tag.
#
# Usage: verify-release.sh <tag>            e.g. verify-release.sh v1.5.1
# Env:   GH_TOKEN          token for `gh` (GITHUB_TOKEN in Actions)
#        VERIFY_TIMEOUT    seconds to wait for async artifacts (default 2100)
#        PUBLISH_REPO      owner/repo the release lives in (default sktelecom/bomlens)
#        GITHUB_REPOSITORY fallback for PUBLISH_REPO
