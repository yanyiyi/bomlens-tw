# attach-installer-checksums.sh — add the desktop installers to SHA256SUMS.txt.
#
# The installers (BomLens-Setup.exe/.dmg) are attached by desktop.yml AFTER
# upload-assets wrote SHA256SUMS.txt, so the release gate calls this script
# once verify-release.sh has confirmed both installers are present. At that
# point every other writer of the release assets has finished, making this the
# single writer of SHA256SUMS.txt (no race). Re-runs are idempotent: existing
# installer lines are replaced, not duplicated.
#
# Usage: attach-installer-checksums.sh <tag>    e.g. attach-installer-checksums.sh v1.5.5
# Env:   GH_TOKEN          token for `gh` (GITHUB_TOKEN in Actions)
#        PUBLISH_REPO      owner/repo the release lives in (default sktelecom/bomlens)
#        GITHUB_REPOSITORY fallback for PUBLISH_REPO
#        DRY_RUN=1         compute and print, but do not upload
