# check-doc-coverage.sh — guard against documenting a new input form in some

#
# The authoritative list of scan modes lives in docker/entrypoint.sh (the
# "expected .../..." line). This script reads it and checks that every
# user-facing mode is (1) registered in the coverage manifest below and
# (2) mentioned in each page that should cover it. Adding a mode to the code
# but forgetting a page therefore fails CI.
